Subject: net: mvmdio: allow up to four clocks to be specified for orion-mdio
Patch-mainline: v5.3-rc1
Git-commit: 4aabed699c400810981d3dda170f05fa4d782905
References: git-fixes

Allow up to four clocks to be specified and enabled for the orion-mdio
interface, which are required by the Armada 8k and defined in
armada-cp110.dtsi.

Fixes a hang in probing the mvmdio driver that was encountered on the
Clearfog GT 8K with all drivers built as modules, but also affects other
boards such as the MacchiatoBIN.
