Subject: [PATCH] bcache: Revert "bcache: shrink btree node cache after
 bch_btree_check()"
Git-commit: 309cc719a2c869b71a7388209a0a80d4284d98fd
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc2
References: bsc#1163762, bsc#1112504, git fixes (block drivers)

This reverts commit 1df3877ff6a4810054237c3259d900ded4468969.

In my testing, sometimes even all the cached btree nodes are freed,
creating gc and allocator kernel threads may still fail. Finally it
turns out that kthread_run() may fail if there is pending signal for
current task. And the pending signal is sent from OOM killer which
is triggered by memory consuption in bch_btree_check().

Therefore explicitly shrinking bcache btree node here does not help,
and after the shrinker callback is improved, as well as pending signals
are ignored before creating kernel threads, now such operation is
unncessary anymore.

This patch reverts the commit 1df3877ff6a4 ("bcache: shrink btree node
cache after bch_btree_check()") because we have better improvement now.
