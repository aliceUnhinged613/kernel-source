Subject: [PATCH] PCI: pciehp: Do not handle events if interrupts are masked
Git-commit: 720d6a671a6e2cf2b9ed032279b7c21c122bed7e
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1
References: FATE#326303

PCIe native hotplug shares MSI vector with native PME so the interrupt
handler might get called even the hotplug interrupt is masked. In that case
we should not handle any events because the interrupt was not meant for us.

Modify the PCIe hotplug interrupt handler to check this accordingly and
bail out if it finds out that the interrupt was not about hotplug.
