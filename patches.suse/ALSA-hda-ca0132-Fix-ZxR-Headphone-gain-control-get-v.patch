Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Fix ZxR Headphone gain control get value.
Git-commit: a00dc409de455b64e6cb2f6d40cdb8237cdb2e83
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: bsc#1111666

When the ZxR headphone gain control was added, the ca0132_switch_get
function was not updated, which meant that the changes to the control
state were not saved when entering/exiting alsamixer.
