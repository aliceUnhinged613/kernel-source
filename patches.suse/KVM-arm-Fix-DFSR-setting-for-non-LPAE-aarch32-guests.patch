Subject: KVM: arm: Fix DFSR setting for non-LPAE aarch32 guests
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
Git-commit: 018f22f95e8a6c3e27188b7317ef2c70a34cb2cd
References: bsc#1133021

Beata reports that KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS doesn't inject the expected
exception to a non-LPAE aarch32 guest.

The host intends to inject DFSR.FS=0x14 "IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED fault
(Lockdown fault)", but the guest receives DFSR.FS=0x04 "Fault on
instruction cache maintenance". This fault is hooked by
do_translation_fault() since ARMv6, which goes on to silently 'handle'
the exception, and restart the faulting instruction.

It turns out, when TTBCR.EAE is clear DFSR is split, and FS[4] has
to shuffle up to DFSR[10].

As KVM only does this in one place, fix up the static values. We
now get the expected:
| Unhandled fault: lock abort (0x404) at 0x9c800f00
