Subject: [PATCH] mmc: block: Fix request completion in the CQE timeout path
Git-commit: c077dc5e0620508a29497dac63a2822324ece52a
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc6
References: bsc#1111666

First, it should be noted that the CQE timeout (60 seconds) is substantial
so a CQE request that times out is really stuck, and the race between
timeout and completion is extremely unlikely. Nevertheless this patch
fixes an issue with it.

Commit ad73d6feadbd7b ("mmc: complete requests from ->timeout")
preserved the existing functionality, to complete the request.
However that had only been necessary because the block layer
timeout handler had been marking the request to prevent it from being
completed normally. That restriction was removed at the same time, the
result being that a request that has gone will have been completed anyway.
That is, the completion was unnecessary.

At the time, the unnecessary completion was harmless because the block
layer would ignore it, although that changed in kernel v5.0.

Note for stable, this patch will not apply cleanly without patch "mmc:
Core: Fix recursive locking issue in CQE recovery path"
