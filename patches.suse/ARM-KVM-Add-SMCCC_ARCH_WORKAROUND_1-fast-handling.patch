Subject: ARM: KVM: Add SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 fast handling
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
Git-commit: b800acfc70d9fb81fbd6df70f2cf5e20f70023d0
References: bsc#1133021

We want SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 to be fast. As fast as possible.
So let's intercept it as early as we can by testing for the
function call number as soon as we've identified a HVC call
coming from the guest.
